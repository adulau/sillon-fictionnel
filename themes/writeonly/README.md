## Live Demo

See [here](https://writeonlyhugo.gitlab.io/writeonlyhugo-demo/).

## Quick Start

If you are creating a new website, the quickest way to get up and running is to
clone the demo website.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/writeonlyhugo/writeonlyhugo-demo.git
```

Alternatively, you can clone just the theme to your theme folder:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/writeonlyhugo/writeonlyhugo-theme.git themes/writeonlyhugo-theme
```

The folder `hugoBasicExample` contains a working version of a website with the
theme. It includes: the configuration file `config.yaml` and the content folder
`content` with the usual markdown examples.

## Quick Test

To test the website:

```bash
cd hugoBasicExample && hugo server --themesDir ../..
```
